Hibernate ORM and SQM Integration PoC

This project represents a proof-of-concept (PoC) for integrating SQM into Hibernate ORM as the basis for SQL generation. A big part of this requires some changes to Hibernate ORM internals to better expose the table/column mapping information. So the PoC acts as a sounding board, too, for these proposed changes. As much as possible each proposed change should have a high-level discussion (as a GitHub repo wiki).

See also the SQM repo for any SQM design discussions. There is obviously a lot of interplay.
