== TODO Items

* Possibly we should maintain a map from Expression -&gt; "select alias" for substitution in other clauses. For example,
	given `select a.b + a.c as s from Anything a order by a.b + a.c` the more efficient query (SQL-wise) is a substitution to
	`select a.b + a.c as s from Anything a order by s`.
* Proper handling for GroupedPredicate alternatives (explicit grouping parenthesis) - ATM I simply
	created a GroupedPredicate class; maybe that is enough
* Proper identification of left and right hand side of joins, at least for joins with ON or WITH clauses. See
	`org.hibernate.query.parser.internal.hql.antlr.SemanticQueryBuilder#visitQualifiedJoinPredicate` for details. Note that I keep
	joins in a flat structure because its easier during the initial phase (frm clause processing); and in fact it might
	be impossible to properly identify the left hand side of an "ad hoc" entity join.
* TREAT should be journaled into the respective FromElement along with some concept of where it came from (because ultimately that
	affects its rendering into SQL). For TREAT in SELECT we may still need a wrapper (see next point too)
* Make sure that FromElements are NEVER used directly in other parts of the query. All references to a FromElement in
	another part of the query should always be "wrapped" in another target (FromElementReferenceExpression, e.g.). Part
	of this is that I do not think its a good idea for all FromElement types (via org.hibernate.sqm.path.AttributePathPart)
	to be Expressions; that change has some bearing on the org.hibernate.query.parser.internal.hql.path.AttributePathResolver
	code.
* Codify the concept of "comparable" types. E.g. given 2 expressions being able to verify that they are valid _in relation to each other_.
	The relation is important, as is possibly late verification to account for parameter bind values.
* Add "default SqlTypeDescriptor" to JavaTypeDescriptor. We already have that code in place in
	`org.hibernate.sql.exec.internal.RecommendedJdbcTypeMappings`, just need to decide what is the easiest way to
	get-at and consume that information. We'd use this when building the ImprovedBasicType if no SqlTypeDescriptor
	is specified. And actually considering other target hints (@Nationalized, @Lob, etc) maybe its better to
	pass along access to all that info (param object). See org.hibernate.target.descriptor.sql.RecommendedJdbcTypeResolver and
	org.hibernate.target.descriptor.sql.RecommendedJdbcTypeResolutionContext in this PoC for an initial design.
* Finish the logic to apply fetches and EntityGraph hints. See `#applyFetchesAndEntityGraph` in
	`org.hibernate.sql.convert.spi.SqmSelectToSqlAstConverter`
* Implement SingularAttributeDescriptor#isNullable - currently always returns true, except for id-attributes which always
 	return false which is actualy ok
* Who is responsible for adding the SqlSelectionDescriptor for fetches?
* Be sure to add test emulating org.hibernate.test.loadplans.plans.LoadPlanStructureAssertionTest#testEncapsulatedCompositeIdWithFetches2
	which tests BidirectionalEntityReference (stand in for circular tree references, to avoid real circularities)
* ? BasicType#getSqlSelectionReader ?  Would make SqlSelectable#getSqlSelectionReader much easier


Keep track of downcasts on FromElement

== Downcasting (TREAT)

Have FromElement (in SQM) maintain a List of down-cast targets. Ultimately we need to know whether to render these
as INNER or OUTER joins. JPA only allows TREAT in FROM and WHERE, so SQM should consider uses in other context a
"strict JPQL violation". 

An alternative to the INNER/OUTER decision is to always render an outer join here (to the subtype tables) and generate a
predicate where ever the TREAT occurs. In the FROM clause it would become part of the join predicate. In there WHERE
clause we'd generate a grouped predicate. In SELECT (?) I guess just render a predicate into the WHERE

== Subclass attribute references

Another piece to determine whether we need to include subclass tables is whether the query referenced any of the
subclass attributes. JPQL disallows this (strict JPQL violation), but HQL allows it.

One option would be to simply handle this via the mechanism for treat. When a subclass attribute is referenced, implicitly
add a TREAT reference to the FromElement.

Another option is to just keep a list of the referenced attributes for each FromElement. On the "back end" we can
work out the subclass table inclusion based on that info.


== TwoPhaseLoad.addUninitializedEntity

The perf team had once identified this as a hot spot.  Check with them whether it still is.  If it is, I think
a possibly better approach would be to keep JdbcValuesSource handling as a set of stacked (as in Stack) of
these with knowledge about its "parent".  This would allow us to ask "up the Stack" whether it knows of a
particular EntityKey being processed.  We could just skip processing that row in handling that child
JdbcValuesSource stack-element

The existing code instead works by adding a temporary "still loading" EntityEntry as a means for other
"nested" JdbcValuesSource processors to see that that entity is still being loaded in a "parent"
JdbcValuesSource.  Later, the parent JdbcValuesSource processor that registered this temp
EntityEntry will complete loading the entity and then register the "real" EntityEntry.  But this creation
of 2 EntityEntry instances (for each load!) ended up being a big hot spot.

To we need similar handling for collection loading?
